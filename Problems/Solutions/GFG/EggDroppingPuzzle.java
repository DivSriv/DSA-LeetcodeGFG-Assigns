//Egg Dropping Puzzle (https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/egg-dropping-puzzle-1587115620/1)

/*

You are given N identical eggs and you have access to a K-floored building from 1 to K.

There exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= K such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break. There are few rules given below. 

An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
A broken egg must be discarded.
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.
If the eggs breaks at a certain floor, it will break at any floor above.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

For more description on this problem see wiki page

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1, K = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
1. Drop the egg from floor 1. If it 
   breaks, we know that f = 0.
2. Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.
   If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
3. If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
4. Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to
   determine with certainty what the value of f is.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2, K = 10
Output: 4
Your Task:
Complete the function eggDrop() which takes two positive integer N and K as input parameters and returns the minimum number of attempts you need in order to find the critical floor.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N*(K^2))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*K)

Constraints:
1<=N<=200
1<=K<=200
